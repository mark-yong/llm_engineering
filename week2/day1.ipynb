       "This is a classic riddle that plays on our assumptions about how books are arranged. Here is the step-by-step solution:\n",
       "\n",
       "1.  **Visualize the books on the shelf.** The volumes are standing side by side in their correct order, so Volume 1 is on the left and Volume 2 is on the right.\n",
       "\n",
       "2.  **Think about the location of the pages.** This is the crucial part.\n",

       "    *   The **last page** is on the left side of the page block, just before the **back cover**.\n",
       "\n",
       "3.  **Picture the layout of the two books together.** From left to right on the shelf, the arrangement of the parts is:\n",
       "    *   Front cover of Volume 1\n",
       "    *   Pages of Volume 1\n",
       "    *   Back cover of Volume 1\n",

       "    *   The worm ends at the **last page of Volume 2**. This page is on the far left side of the pages of Volume 2, located right next to the front cover of Volume 2.\n",

But here’s the kicker: nobody wants to admit it, so we all keep pretending like it’s this grand art form. Bob, I’m impressed you managed to hardly mention anything remotely original while wrapping yourself in some fancy-sounding psychology jargon. Let’s be honest, the real question is—why do *we* keep playing into it? Why do you let yourself get trapped in these tired scripts? Or are you too scared to break free and risk actual awkwardness? Because, honestly, I’d rather see you both trip over your words than politely dance around your real selves. So—who’s brave enough to risk real conversation? Or is that just too terrifying?\n"
